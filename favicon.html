    <h1>favicon falling sand</h1>
    <h2>What the fuck?</h2>
    <p>
        Check your favicon. Looks familiar, doesn't it. Oh, it's the canvas below.
        <br>
        And for why, before you ask, simply, why not. The falling sand game comeback is here.

    <h2>How?</h2>
    <p>
        Just a data URL of the canvas you're seeing. That's it.
        <br>
        Techniques like this have been used for a couple utilities and games... my turn.
    </p>

    <h2>Browser war type shit?</h2>
    <p>
        On Firefox, it refreshes SIGNIFICANTLY faster than Chrome. It's completely worth it.
        <br>
        Twice as fast, maybe. Really.
    </p>

    <h2>Info</h2>
    <p>
        This actually uses a pretty extensive, moddable interface for falling sand.
        <br>
        It even has custom element support with update callbacks, so go on and program a nuke.
        <br>
        I highly encourage JS developers to take a peek at this page. 
        <br>
        I think it's nice (not neat... the code's ass).

        Canvas is there. Play around for a bit.
